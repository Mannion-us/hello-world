# hello-world
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/   ( Doesn't everyone have one? )

This is my first readme.md file.

I am not sure what to write for this exercise so I am just going to "wing-it!!!"  This is just an exercise anyway so I thought that I would add some simple text to start.

My next few edits will be more meaningful.

I guess that's it for now.  Time to commit with comments.
